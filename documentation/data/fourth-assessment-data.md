## 4th California Climate Change Assessment Data

Rim inflow multiplier data generated by project team #4A for the California Fourth Climate Assessment (2018).

The Excel file `rim-inflow-overview.xlsx` in [./calvin/data/fourth-assessment/](../../calvin/data/fourth-assessment-data/) explains which rim inflows for the Calvin model have multipliers derived directly from projection data, and which are found by correlation with other rim inflow values. 

The folder [rim-inflow-multipliers/](../../calvin/data/fourth-assessment-data/rim-inflow-multipliers/) contains CSV files of the resulting data for each of the bias-corrected downscaled GCM projections. The format of the files is: one row for each month (12 rows), and one column for each of the reservoir points in the model.
